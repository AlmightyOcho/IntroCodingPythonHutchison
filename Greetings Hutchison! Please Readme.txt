Hello! My name is Ryan Coleman & it's been a pleasure to teach  this 'Intro to Coding 101: Intro to Python' coding camp with you this Summer!

A little bit about me: I am currently a Junior at the University of Memphis, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science. I love all things tech (IoT, aka the internet of things) and am 'highly intrigued with anything that possesses a motherboard or lines of code'. Also...I LOVE Indian food.

Within the two folders (Python Week 1 & 2) I have included some summaries of the topics we've covered regarding the Python programming language as well as the code samples that we covered in class. Below, I will include a breakdown of our two weeks:

Python Week 1: Intro. to the syntax, 'Hello World', Simple Operations, Float, Strings, String Operations, Variables, Loops...

Python Week 2: Modules, pip, Input(), Types, Loops (Cont'd.), methods, functions, If/Else, Conditinoals, Boolean, Lists/Dictionaries...

Of course, I certainly could not have made this camp possible without the help of some outside resources...
